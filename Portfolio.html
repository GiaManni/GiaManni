    Hi, I'm Georgia! <br/>
    <a href="https://github.com/GiaManni" target="_blank">Backend Developer</a>,

  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Georgia Isiodu, a Software Engineering learner at ALX, currently focused on backend development using Python and the Django framework.
    With a strong interest in solving real-world problems through code, I‚Äôm passionate about creating scalable and efficient web solutions that serve communities and businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    At ALX, I‚Äôve been developing both my technical and problem-solving skills through rigorous, hands-on learning. One of my proudest moments so far has been building a prototype for an app that assists farmers with plant diseases and pests. This gave me a clear sense of how software can power everyday solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My long-term goal is to use technology to support small businesses, especially those led by women and youth in underserved communities.
    I'm motivated by the impact that thoughtful, inclusive software can make in addressing challenges like inequality and limited access to digital tools.
    I look forward to growing my skills further, contributing to meaningful projects, and becoming a strong force for change in the tech ecosystem.
